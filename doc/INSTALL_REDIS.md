# Redis Server

Before installing Redis, we recommend that you read through the [security model of Redis](https://redis.io/topics/security), which is meant to be run within a strictly trusted environment. The below installation, and PANIC in general takes this security model into account and includes the suggested security boosts.

## Installation

You can either install Redis directly on your system or use Docker. 
The former contains extra optional steps to reconfigure and secure Redis which are also useful if you choose the latter approach.

### Installing Directly to System

1. To install **Redis server** on your system:
    - On Linux, run:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install redis-server           # install Redis
      sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service  # set Redis to start on boot
      ```
    - On Windows, follow the installation steps [here](https://riptutorial.com/redis/example/29962/installing-and-running-redis-server-on-windows)

2. To **configure Redis**:
    1. First access the `redis.conf` file:
        - On Linux: `sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf`
        - On Windows: this is in the `conf/` folder of the installation directory.
    2. In the `GENERAL` section, add (or uncomment) the line `bind 127.0.0.1` to bind Redis only to localhost. This assumes that Redis is installed on the same system that will run the alerter.
    3. In the `SECURITY` section, add (or uncomment) the line `requirepass <PASS>`, where `<PASS>` is a complex password of your choosing. The alerter will ask for this password during setup.
    4. In the `SECURITY` section, you can also choose to disable some commands to prevent some actions from taking place. For each command, add a line: `rename-command <COMMAND> ""`.
        -  The following commands are *not* used by PANIC and can thus be disabled: `FLUSHALL`, `PEXPIRE`, `CONFIG`, `SHUTDOWN`, `BGREWRITEAOF`, `BGSAVE`, `SAVE`, `SPOP`, `SREM`, `RENAME` and `DEBUG`.
    5. On Linux, restart Redis to apply changes: `sudo service redis-server restart`

3. To **run Redis**:
    - On Linux, the Redis server should already be running.
    - On Windows, run `redis-server.exe` from the installation directory as administrator with the config file as an argument: `.\redis-server.exe conf\redis.conf`

**At the end, you should have:**
1. Redis server installed, secured, and running.
2. Ability to use Redis via the `redis-cli` command.
    - On Windows, `redis-cli.exe` is found in the installation directory.
    - To use Redis via the `redis-cli`, remember to authenticate using your password: `AUTH <PASSWORD>`.
    - Note that you do not have to have the *cli* running for the alerter to work.

### Installing using Docker

To install and run Redis server on your system:

```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

To make sure that Redis is running:

```bash
docker ps
```
