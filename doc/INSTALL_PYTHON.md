# Python (with pip and pipenv)

1. To install **Python v3.7.4 or greater**, you can [follow this guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).
2. To install **pip** package manager:
    - On Linux, run: `apt-get install python3-pip`.
    - On Windows, it should come included in the installation.
3. To install **pipenv** packaging tool, run `pip install pipenv`.  
 (If 'pip' is not found, try using 'pip3' instead.)

**At the end, you should be able to:**
1. Get the Python version by running `python --version`.  
 (You may have to replace 'python' with 'python3.6', 'python3.7', etc.)
2. Get the pip version by running `pip --version`.
3. Get the pipenv version by running `pipenv --version`.
